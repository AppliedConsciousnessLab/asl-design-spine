# Visibility Model

Visibility is a design decision, not a default.

---

## Life Modes
- public
- private
- dreamit

---

## Access Tiers
- free
- 100k
- 1m

---

## Canonical Override

ASL-GSS-000 overrides all access controls.

If safety is implicated, visibility is forced open.

This is a moral checksum.
