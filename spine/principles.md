# Spine Principles

These principles govern all ASL-aligned systems.

They are not metrics.
They are not KPIs.
They are not dashboards.

They exist to prevent category errors.

## Principle 1 — End in Mind, Course Correction Thereafter

Life is about knowing what you want (having the end in mind).
Then it is about course correction.

This principle belongs in:
- Design framing
- Philosophy
- Governance context

It does NOT belong in:
- Performance metrics
- Incentive systems
- Gamified rules

Wisdom cannot be optimized without being destroyed.

---

## Principle 2 — Safety Precedes Optimization

No system may optimize before safety is established.
No throughput justifies harm.

---

## Principle 3 — Coherence Over Control

Systems must support regulation and coherence.
Control without coherence creates fragility.

---

## Principle 4 — Visibility Is Intentional

Visibility is never assumed.
Access is explicit, scoped, and revocable.

---

## Principle 5 — Reversibility Over Speed

If a decision cannot be reversed safely, it must not be rushed.

---

## Principle 6 — Humans Think, Systems Persist

Humans decide.
