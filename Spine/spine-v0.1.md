# ASL Design Spine — v0.1

## Status
LOCKED — INITIAL CANON

## Purpose
This spine governs all ASL-aligned systems, including but not limited to:
- GSS
- EP
- CARE / PAYBACK
- HyKin
- Future safety-aligned platforms

It defines constraints, not implementations.

## Design Rule

Canon → Schema → Data

No system element may exist unless it can be traced to canon.

## Mutability Rule

- Canon is immutable without version bump
- Schema changes require approved canon
- Data may change only within schema constraints

## Boundary Rule

This spine does not contain:
- Phases
- Tasks
- Roadmaps
- Status indicators

Those belong in runtime systems.

## Authority

Final authority rests with the designated human owner.
AI systems have zero authority.
